# bash-scripts
Learning to work faster using scripts.
1. Backup-Creator - Made this 'tool' to backup my data in Downloads, Pictures, Music and Documents.
2. Dir-File-Copier - Made this to create a README.md file that gets copied into ALOT of new folders(saved 2 minutes of manually doing it).
3. NTFS-Fixer - Made this for my upgrade of Ubuntu when it kept messing with my boot files and almost corrupting my windows partition.
4. Made this to format my USB, though its easier to just right click the usb and click format, i prefer terminal.
